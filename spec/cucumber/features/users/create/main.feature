# Feature: Create User

#   Clients should be able to send a request to our API in order to create a
#   user. Our API should also validate the structure of the payload and respond
#   with an error if it is invalid.

#   Scenario: Empty Payload

#     If the client sends a POST request to /users with a unsupported payload, it
#     should receive a response with a 4xx status code.

#     When the client creates a POST request to /users
#     And attaches a generic empty payload
#     And sends the request
#     Then our API should respond with a 400 HTTP status code
#     And the payload of the response should be a JSON object
#     And contains a message property which says "Payload should not be empty"



#   Scenario: Payload using Unsupported Media Type

#     If the client sends a POST request to /users with an payload that is
#     not JSON,
#     it should receive a response with a 415 Unsupported Media Type HTTP
#     status code.

#     When the client creates a POST request to /users
#     And attaches a generic non-JSON payload
#     And sends the request
#     Then our API should respond with a 415 HTTP status code
#     And the payload of the response should be a JSON object
#     And contains a message property which says 'The "Content-Type" header must always be "application/json"'

#   Scenario: Malformed JSON Payload

#     If the client sends a POST request to /users with an payload that is
#     malformed,
#     it should receive a response with a 400 Unsupported Media Type HTTP
#     status code.

#     When the client creates a POST request to /users
#     And attaches a generic malformed payload
#     And sends the request
#     Then our API should respond with a 400 HTTP status code
#     And the payload of the response should be a JSON object
#     And contains a message property which says "Payload should be in JSON format"

Feature: Create User

  Clients should be able to send a request to our API in order to create a
  user. Our API should also validate the structure of the payload and respond
  with an error if it is invalid.

  Scenario Outline: Bad Client Requests

    If the client sends a POST request to /users with an empty payload, it
    should receive a response with a 4xx Bad Request HTTP status code.

    When the client creates a POST request to /users
    And attaches a generic <payloadType> payload
    And sends the request
    Then our API should respond with a <statusCode> HTTP status code
    And the payload of the response should be a JSON object
    And contains a message property which says <message>

    Examples:

      | payloadType | statusCode | message                                                       |
      | empty       | 400        | "Payload should not be empty"                                 |
      | non-JSON    | 415        | 'The "Content-Type" header must always be "application/json"' |
      | malformed   | 400        | "Payload should be in JSON format"                            |
